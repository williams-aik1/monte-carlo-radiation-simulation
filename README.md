# CT-Based Monte Carlo Radiation Dose Simulation

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates **radiation dose deposition in human tissue** using real CT (DICOM) images. It compares a simple deterministic beam model with a **Monte Carlo photon transport simulation** to demonstrate how beam targeting improves tumor dose delivery.

The application includes an interactive web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload CT scans and visualize radiation dose distribution in real time.

## ⚛️ Technical Approach

### 1. Hounsfield Unit Conversion

CT pixel values are converted to physical density using:

```
HU = pixel_value × slope + intercept
```

---

### 2. Tissue Segmentation

| Tissue Type | HU Range    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Air         | HU < -500   |
| Soft Tissue | -500 to 300 |
| Bone        | HU ≥ 300    |

---

### 3. Radiation Attenuation Model

Each tissue type is assigned an attenuation coefficient:

| Tissue      | μ (attenuation) |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Air         | 0.02            |
| Soft Tissue | 0.20            |
| Bone        | 0.50            |

Radiation follows exponential attenuation:

```
I = I₀ · exp(-μx)
```

---

### 4. Monte Carlo Simulation

Photons are simulated individually with:

* Random interactions based on probability:

  ```
  P(interaction) = 1 - exp(-μ)
  ```
* Energy deposition at interaction points
* Random lateral scattering
* Energy decay after each interaction

---

### 5. Tumor Targeting

* Tumor region defined within soft tissue
* Targeted beam focuses photons near tumor
* Increased energy deposition inside tumor region

---

## 📊 Results & Insights

### 🔬 Key Findings

* Targeted beam delivers **~40× higher tumor dose** compared to random beam
* Monte Carlo simulation produces realistic stochastic dose patterns
* Soft tissue absorbs the highest radiation dose
* Bone shows minimal dose due to high attenuation

### 📉 Tumor Analysis

* Mean tumor dose significantly increases with targeting
* Underdose probability ≈ **40%**, showing dose variability
